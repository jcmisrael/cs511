Concurrency is study of interacting comp. progs which share resources and run concurrently

Assumptions:
- No shared vars in critical and non-critical sections
- Crit section terminates
- Scheduler is weakly fair (A process waiting will eventually be able to run)

MEP
- Mutex : One thread at a time
- Absence of deadlock
- Free from starvation

Styles:
Break symmetry
take turns (+ + -) (Could loop in non-crit)

states:
- inactive
- ready
- running
- blocked
- completed

R/W
Service queue solution
If first reader acquire resource, otherwise read because another reader is already in
